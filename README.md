## Automatic backup 

1. Clone the project. 
2. Copy run.ts.sample to run.ts. 
3. Set up your backup parameters. 
4. Call run.bat to make a backup.
5. Use task scheduler of preference to set up scheduled backup.

## Prerequisites

1. Deno (deno.exe could be put right into the folder with sources)
2. 7zip
3. Firebird 2.5 or Firebird 3.0 (only in case Firebird databases would be backed up)
